## Setup for this Assignment

For this assignment, I used python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">virtual environment</a> for development purposes. 
The scripts should be able to work assuming you have the dependencies listed in the ```asg2_starter_code/requirements.txt``` file in your machine.

If you would like to imitate my environment, do the following

1. Install virtualenv

2. Check that you are currently inside this folder in your terminal using pwd
3. Create a virtualenv
```
virtualenv venv
```
4. Install dependencies in requirements.txt
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
