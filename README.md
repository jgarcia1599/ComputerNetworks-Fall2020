# ComputerNetworks
Professor Anirudh Sivaraman 
New York University, Fall 2020

This course will introduce students to computer networks, using today's Internet as an example. Topics covered include socket programming, routing, forwarding, reliable transmission, congestion control, and medium access control. The course will involve a good deal of programming in Python. Familiarity with programming, algorithms, and basic probability is expected.
