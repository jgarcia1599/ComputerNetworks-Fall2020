send data
```python
from socket import *
sock_object = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM)
sock_object.sendto(b"hello",("127.0.0.1",8000))
```

check data transfer
```
nc -l 8000 -u -> to send socket data and test
```

receive data
```python
from socket import *
sock_receiver = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM)
sock_receiver.bind(("127.0.0.1",8000))
sock_receiver.recv(4096)
```

do not wait 
```python
sock_receiver.setblocking(False)
```
    
Why would we want to use a non-blocking receiver?
