# Computer Networks Assignment 2

## Setup for this Assignment

For this assignment, I used python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">virtual environment</a> for development purposes. 
The scripts should be able to work assuming you have the dependencies listed in the ```asg2_starter_code/requirements.txt``` file in your machine.

If you would like to imitate my environment, do the following

1. Install virtualenv

2. ```cd asg2_starter_code/```
3. Create a virtualenv
```
virtualenv venv
```
4. Install dependencies in requirements.txt
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Graphs

To generate most of the graphs, I used Jupyter Notebook. For EWMA and AIMD, I plotted the graphs with custom code I embedded into the provided  python file.The script for each graph can be found  on the ```asg2_starter_code/writtenresponses.md``` file underneath each generated graph.


## Written Responses to Questions

The written responses for each question in the assignment can be found on ```asg2_starter_code/writtenresponses.md```.
